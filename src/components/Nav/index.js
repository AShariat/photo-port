            // Whenever we map over anything in JSX, the outermost element must have a key attribute that's set to be something unique. This helps React keep track of items in the virtual DOM. In this case, we used category.name because we don't expect any categories to share the same name. Often the key will be an id. Note also the use of parentheses in the map callback to return JSX. When you map over an array in a JSX expression, you should return only a single JSX elementâ€”like how you can only return a single element from a React component.
            <li className="mx-1" key={category.name}>
